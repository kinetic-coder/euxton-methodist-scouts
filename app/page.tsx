        <p>Welcome, we are Euxton Methodist scout group, a busy, active group who are based in the villiage on Euxton located in the North West of England.</p>
        <p>We pride ourselves in providing our young people with the opportunity to grow, be safe and just as important, to have fun</p>

        <p>We generally meet at Euxton Methodist Church hall but do get out and about so we keep Scout parents updated with a weekly email.</p>
